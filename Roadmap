Roadmap

Phase	Tasks
Phase 1: Learning	Complete. Build a basic multiplayer prototype.
Step 1: 
Learn the Basics of PurrNet
Complete set up a basic multiplayer game in Unity.
Key Concepts to Focus On:
Setting up a server and client.
Synchronizing player movement and actions.
Handling basic interactions (e.g., shooting, picking up items).

Step 2:
Core Gameplay Loop:
Players explore a small open-world map.
They fight AI enemies (e.g., mutants or bandits).
They collect loot (weapons, ammo, artifacts) and complete objectives.

Multiplayer Features:
Co-op mode for 2-4 players.
Basic PvP (optional, for later).

Atmosphere:
Dark, eerie environment with dynamic weather and day-night cycles.

Phase 2: Core Game	Implement player movement, shooting, AI enemies, and loot system.
Step 3:
1. Player Movement and Synchronization
Use PurrNet to sync player movement, rotation, and animations.
Add a basic FPS controller (you can find free or paid ones on the Unity Asset Store).
2. Weapons and Shooting
Implement a basic shooting system.
Sync shooting, reloading, and ammo counts across players.
Add hit detection for both players and AI enemies.
3. AI Enemies
Start with simple AI (e.g., enemies that chase and attack players).
Sync enemy positions and states (e.g., idle, chasing, attacking) across the network.
4. Loot and Inventory
Create a system for picking up items (weapons, ammo, artifacts).
Sync inventory data across players.
5. Objectives and Quests
Add simple objectives (e.g., “Kill 5 mutants” or “Find the artifact”).
Sync objective progress across players.

Phase 3: Polish, objectives, and survival mechanics.

Step 4:
Atmosphere:
Add dynamic weather (rain, fog) and a day-night cycle.
Use sound effects and music to create tension.

Anomalies and Artifacts:
Create hazardous zones (anomalies) that damage players.
Add artifacts that grant special abilities but have trade-offs.

Exploration:
Expand your map with hidden loot, secrets, and points of interest.

Survival Mechanics:
Add hunger, radiation, and health management systems.

Phase 4: Expand	(anomalies, artifacts, larger map).
Phase 5: Test, optimize, and release.
